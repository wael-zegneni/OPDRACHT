# Frontend Coding Challenge

## Overview
This project is the result of a frontend coding challenge that focuses on translating a given design into a fully functional and responsive webpage. The design was brought to life using HTML and advanced SASS techniques, emphasizing functionality, user interaction, and responsive design.

## Project Structure
The project is structured with a clear separation of concerns, utilizing a SASS architecture for styling. Here's an overview of the directory structure:

- `assets/`: Contains all the static resources such as fonts, icons, and images.
- `css/`: Contains the compiled CSS files.
- `scss/`:
  - `base/`: Basic foundational styles.
  - `layout/`: Styling for major layout components like the header and footer.
  - `sections/`: Styling for distinct page sections like hero, news, and work.
  - `utils/`: Utility files including mixins and variables.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `package.json`: Lists the project dependencies and its configurations.
- `README.md`: The file you're reading now.

## Running the Project
To view the project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open `index.html` with your web browser to see the project live.

## Design Implementation
The design was provided as a PNG and a Figma file. The implementation strives to be faithful to the provided design while also being flexible across different screen sizes.

## Development Approach
With a time constraint of 4 hours, the development process was prioritized as follows:
1. Setting up a robust SASS structure to manage styles efficiently.
2. Developing a responsive layout using modern CSS properties like Flexbox and Media Queries.
3. Adding refined hover effects, animations, and transitions to enhance user experience.

Personal enhancements were made where appropriate to give the design more flavor without deviating from the design's core concept.

## Responsiveness
The webpage is responsive and works well on different devices. Media queries and REM units are employed to ensure that the layout and text scale appropriately.
